Text Mine Friendly Library Databases (behind paywalls)	Numerous vendors are allowing text-mining access to their databases. It is possible to get a decent amount of newspaper articles from Expanded Academic ASAP and Lexis Nexis, for example.	Since these take a bit of manipulating to get working correctly, they really need their own write ups.
